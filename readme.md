This repository shows development and testing techniques with [Angular 2](https://angular.io/).
The application is written in modern Javascript without Typescript.
It can be ideal for those who are new to Angular 2 and want to learn how things work 
and fiddle with Typescript later.

It is a basic CRUD application with authentication, similar to the news site [jslive.com](https://jslive.com).
You can see the list of links, add and edit them after you signed in.

- Modern Javascript implementation with classes, decorators.
- Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to support decorators.
- Same language constructs can be used as in Typescript (types will be stripped).
- Bundles files with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).
- Automates tasks with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
- Automatically rebundles and refreshes the browser on changes.
- Unit testing with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
- Code coverage for original ES6 code.
- Includes deployment to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).
- Linting with [ESlint](http://eslint.org/) based on [Airbnb's styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Layout and namings based on the [official Angular 2 style guide](https://angular.io/styleguide)

### Concepts covered

- Creating components with directives
- Communication between child and parent components
- Dependency injection for services
- Change detection strategies
- Using custom pipes in templates
- Handling HTTP calls
- Using observables
- Routing
- Authentication and restricting access to routes
- Form handling
- Using custom validators in forms
- Internationalization with [ng2-translate](https://github.com/ocombe/ng2-translate)

### Quick Start

```bash

git clone https://github.com/blacksonic/angular2-babel-esnext-starter.git
cd angular2-babel-esnext-starter
npm install

gulp serve

```

It bundles the application, copies the static files and starts the webserver with Nodemon.
The transpiled application will have two separate ES5 compatible files: ```vendor.js``` for vendor libraries, ```boot.js``` for application logic.
Server side changes restart the server, client side changes rebundle the Angular 2 application and refresh the page with Livereload.

Note: The application needs at least Node 5+ installed.

Open it in your browser [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) and start coding your first Angular 2 application in Javascript!

### Testing

```bash

gulp test

```

Runs tests with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
Uses a single entry point (```setup.spec.js```), which includes all the ```*.spec.js``` files and runs the tests inside them.
The test files can be found in the ```client/app``` folder next to the source files.

Because a clean bundling with Webpack can take multiple seconds, it is not ideal for development to run a clean test run every time.
Instead it can run continuously on your development machine.

```bash

gulp test-dev

```

### Workarounds

**No more is needed, code can be written as in Typescript!**

Read about the details how it is implemented [in this article](http://shuheikagawa.com/blog/2016/05/08/angular-2-with-babel/).

### Authentication

It is implemented with the router's built-in lifecycle events.
For a detailed explanation [read this article](https://medium.com/@blacksonic86/angular-2-authentication-revisited-611bf7373bf9).

### Deployment (to Heroku)

It bundles the client application and copies static files and server files to the ```dist``` directory along with ```package.json```.
Then it can be commited to the desired location (for example Heroku).

```bash

gulp dist

cd dist
git init
git add -A .
git commit -m "Deploy #1" && echo Committed
git push -f git@heroku.com:angular2-es6-starter.git master

```
